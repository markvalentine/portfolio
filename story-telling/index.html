                <p>The taxi's radio was tuned to a classical FM brodcast.  Janacek's Sinfonietta - probably no the ideal music to hear in a taxi caught in traffic.  The middle-aged driver didn't seem to be listening ver closely either.  With his mouth clamed shut, he stared straight ahead at the endless line fo cars stretching out on the elevated expressway, like a veteran fisherman standing in the bow of his boar, reading the ominous confluence of two currents.  Aomame settled into the borad back seat, closed her eiyes, and listened to the music.<br/><br/>How many people could recognize Janacek's Sinfonietta after hearing just the first few bars? Probably somewhere between "very few" and "almost none".  Bust for some reaasong, Aomame was one of the frew who could.</p>
