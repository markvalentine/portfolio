                <p><strong>Dear friends and family of Quincy Brave Conway,</strong><br/><br/>We have made this page for Quincy in the hopes to give people a space to share their memories of him, the impact he had, and who he was for so many people.<br/><br/>We have a rough phone application that we hope will be a tool in celebrating and remembering his life - if you have an iPhone/iPad, please sign up using the link at the bottom.<br/><br/>Otherwise, feel free to use this page, which we made in an effort to make it easier for Quincy's friends and family to share their thoughts.<br/><br/>We plan to gift all of these memories to the family at a later date in a presentable book form. We will also make sure that what you share here is preserved for you to revisit and cherish.<br/><br/>We're new at this, and ask for some forgiveness in using both the app and this site, as it is still in the works. We are a small group of individuals dedicated to helping people celebrate the lives of loved ones. Some of us attended SFPrep, and we've gone through similar life experiences; Mikahla helped many of us through the process, and we hope we can return the favor now to all of Quincy's friends and family.<br/><br/>Our thoughts are with you all.</p>
